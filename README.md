# Symptom-Based Disease Prediction System

Early detection of diseases is critical for effective treatment and improved patient outcomes. This project leverages machine learning to create a **Symptom-Based Disease Prediction System**, which identifies potential medical conditions based on user-provided symptoms. The platform also offers **diet chart recommendations** tailored to the predicted diagnosis, promoting holistic health management.

## 🚀 Features
- **Disease Prediction**: Utilize advanced ML algorithms (SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest) to predict diseases with high precision.
- **Diet Chart Recommendations**: Generate personalized nutritional plans based on predicted conditions.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Interactive and intuitive web-based interface built with **React** and **Tailwind CSS**.
- **Reliability**: Trained on comprehensive medical datasets to ensure accuracy and reliability.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Firebase (working on authentication and database)
- **Machine Learning Models**: SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest
- **Languages**: Python (for ML models), JavaScript (for frontend integration)
